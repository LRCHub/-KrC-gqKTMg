Think I only want one number
in my phone
I might change your contact
to don't leave me alone
You said you like my eyes
and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen now
you got me feelin' thrown
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh, blah, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song I wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me
thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach
when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex
but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill
I must have lost it
I don't even know
I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking, I'm talking,
I'm talking, all around clock
I'm talking hope nobody knocks
I'm talking opposite of soft
I'm talking wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like blah,
blah, bleh, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me
thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach
when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good
I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex
but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill
I musta lost it
I don't even know
I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
This song catchier than
chicken poxes
I bet your house is
where my other sock is
Woke up this morning thought
I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take
your clothes off pop quiz?
